# ROS 2 Introduction

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Purpose in Physical AI

In the context of Physical AI, ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of the robot, providing:

- **Communication backbone**: Allows different robot components to communicate
- **Hardware abstraction**: Provides uniform interfaces to different hardware
- **Modular architecture**: Enables development of reusable robot software components
- **Middleware services**: Handles message passing, service calls, and action management

## Key Components

1. **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
2. **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
3. **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
4. **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
5. **Parameters**: Configuration values that nodes can share

## Why ROS 2 for Physical AI?

- **Real-time capabilities**: Essential for robot control
- **Middleware flexibility**: Supports various communication patterns
- **Distributed architecture**: Supports multi-robot systems
- **Large ecosystem**: Extensive community and available packages
- **Industry standard**: Widely adopted in robotics research and industry
