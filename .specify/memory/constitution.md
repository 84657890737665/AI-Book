# AI-native Software Development Research Paper Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
All factual claims must be traceable to credible sources; Each assertion requires verification against peer-reviewed literature or official documentation; No speculation without proper attribution.

### Clarity for Academic Audience
Written content targets computer science professionals with clear explanations; Technical concepts explained with accessible language appropriate for Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 level; Complex ideas broken into digestible sections with examples where appropriate.

### Reproducibility through Proper Documentation
All claims and methodologies must be fully documented with step-by-step procedures; Sources and citations follow standardized format to enable replication; Research methodology clearly outlined with sufficient detail for reproducibility.

### Rigor through Peer-Reviewed Standards
Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed articles or academic publications; Claims validated through cross-referencing multiple authoritative sources; Methodology follows established academic research protocols.

### Integrity through Originality
Zero tolerance for plagiarism with comprehensive checks before submission; All borrowed ideas properly attributed; Self-plagiarism avoided even with author's own prior work.

### Completeness through Comprehensive Coverage
Minimum 15 sources required to support arguments; Word count maintained between 5,000-7,000 words; All major aspects of AI-native software development covered with evidence-based arguments.

## Standards for Research Quality

### Citation Standards
All sources cited in APA format consistently throughout the paper; Bibliography includes only cited works; Both in-text citations and reference list maintained with precision.

### Source Quality Requirements
Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed articles from academic journals; Conference papers from reputable venues acceptable; Industry reports and whitepapers allowed only when no academic equivalent available; Personal blogs and informal sources prohibited.

### Content Quality Standards
Writing clarity maintained at Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 level; Technical accuracy verified by domain experts when possible; All diagrams and figures properly labeled and referenced; All tables formatted consistently following academic standards.

## Research Constraints and Requirements

### Formatting Requirements
Final submission in PDF format with embedded citations; Font: Times New Roman 12pt for body text; Double-spacing maintained throughout document; Page numbers, headers, and footers formatted according to guidelines.

### Submission Criteria
Word count must fall within 5,000-7,000 words inclusive of bibliography; At least 15 sources cited in the reference list; Zero percent plagiarism tolerance as measured by institutional detection tools; All claims must be supported by verifiable sources.

### Quality Gates
Pass plagiarism check before submission; All factual claims verified against original sources; Citations formatted correctly in APA style; All figures and tables properly attributed and formatted.

## Success Criteria and Validation

### Acceptance Criteria
All claims verified against reliable sources with proper citations; Zero plagiarism detected by institutional checking tools; Paper passes fact-checking review by academic peers; Meets word count and source count requirements.

### Quality Assurance Process
At least two independent reviewers verify factual accuracy; Plagiarism checker validates originality; Editor reviews for clarity and formatting compliance; Final proofreading conducted to eliminate grammatical errors.

### Publication Readiness
Document formatted according to academic standards; All figures and tables properly embedded; Reference list complete and compliant with APA format; All sections contribute meaningfully to research objectives.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI-native software development research paper creation process. All contributors must familiarize themselves with these principles and follow them strictly.

Amendments to this constitution require:
- Justification for proposed changes
- Review by lead researcher
- Approval by research team consensus
- Update to all dependent documents

Quality compliance reviews will be conducted at each milestone to ensure adherence to these principles. All sections of the paper must pass constitution compliance checks before final submission.
