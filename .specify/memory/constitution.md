# Research Paper on AI-Native Software Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
Every claim, fact, and assertion in the research paper must be supported by primary sources; All data points, statistics, and findings must be traceable to original publications; Accuracy must be prioritized over efficiency when conducting literature reviews.

### II. Clarity for Academic Audience
All writing must target computer science professionals and researchers; Technical concepts should be explained with precision and appropriate terminology; Accessibility to readers with computer science background but potentially limited domain expertise should be maintained.

### III. Reproducibility
All claims, data, and methodologies referenced must be properly documented to enable verification; Proper citation of sources should allow others to replicate literature searches and fact-checking; Research methodology must be transparent and reproducible.

### IV. Rigor through Peer-Reviewed Sources
Priority must be given to peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and academic journals; Theoretical frameworks should be grounded in validated research literature; Expert testimony and grey literature may supplement but never replace peer-reviewed sources.

### V. Fact-Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every factual statement must be linked to a verifiable source; Claims must maintain a clear chain of custody from original research to paper content; Unverified claims or opinions must be explicitly labeled as such.

### VI. Zero-Tolerance for Academic Dishonesty
All content must undergo plagiarism detection before submission; Paraphrasing must maintain accuracy while avoiding copy-paste; Proper attribution must be given for all intellectual contributions, regardless of format.

## Standards and Constraints

### Writing and Citation Standards
- All factual claims must be traceable to reliable sources
- Citation format must follow APA style guidelines
- At least 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed articles
- Zero tolerance for plagiarism before submission
- Writing clarity must maintain Flesch-Kincaid grade level 10-12

### Research Scope Constraints
- Word count must remain between 5,000-7,000 words
- Minimum of 15 sources required
- Final format must be PDF with embedded citations
- Submission deadline must align with conference/journal requirements

## Success Criteria and Quality Gates

### Pre-Publication Verification
- All claims must be verified against original sources
- Zero plagiarism must be detected by scanning tools
- Paper must pass fact-checking review by subject matter experts
- Peer review process must be completed successfully

### Post-Publication Monitoring
- Errata process must be established for corrections
- Impact metrics should be tracked post-publication
- Updates to information must be planned for future editions if applicable

## Governance

All research activities must comply with this constitution; Amendments to these principles require documentation of rationale and impact assessment; Research integrity violations must be reported following institutional policies; Literature reviews and fact-checking must be conducted systematically to ensure quality.
